Rules of Beleaguered Castle
===========================

Deck
----
The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.

Layout
------
The aces are separated from the rest of the deck 
and laid face up in a single column down the centre of the table to form 
the foundations.  The remaining 48 cards are shuffled thoroughly and then
laid out face up in 8 overlapping rows, of 6 cards each, at each side of 
the foundation piles.

Objective
---------
To move all the cards from the rows to the foundations.

Game Play
---------
At each turn a single card is moved from one of the rows to either the 
foundation or the end of another row.  Rows are built in ascending 
numerical order, regardless of suit or suit colour.  That is, a Queen may 
only be placed on a King, a Jack only on a Queen and so on.  Any card may 
be moved from a row to an empty row.
The foundations are built up from Ace to King by suit, that is the Two of 
Spades may only go on the foundation with the top card of Ace of Spades, 
the Seven of Hearts may only go on the Six of Hearts and so on.  Once 
placed on a foundation pile a card may not be moved off again.  The game 
ends when the objective is complete, i.e. all cards have been correctly 
placed on the foundations, in which case the game is won, or if there are 
still cards on the rows and there are no more legal moves, in which case 
the game is lost.
